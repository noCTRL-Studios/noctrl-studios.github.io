I’ve been exploring ways to merge CAD modeling, 3D printing, and smart technology.  
This pocket‑sized NFC container demonstrates that blend: a custom‑modeled case with cavities in the base and lid to securely hold an NFC chip.

## What NFC Adds

NFC transforms a simple container into a smart marketing tool — perfect for shops, Etsy sellers, and makers who want instant digital engagement.

Near Field Communication (NFC) allows a phone or reader to trigger actions when tapped.  
For shops and makers, this means:
- Linking directly to your website or Etsy store
- Sharing social media profiles instantly
- Providing product authentication or special offers
- Supporting multiple automations or URLs on a single chip

By embedding the chip into a physical container, you get a **smart product** that bridges digital and physical worlds.

## How I Made It
- **CAD Modeling**: Designed the container with precise cavities for the chip.  
- **3D Printing**: Printed the base and lid using durable filament.  
- **Integration**: Inserted the NFC chip into the cavity for a snug fit.  
- **Demo**: Scanned with a phone to trigger shop links and automations.
