# About Me

I’m **Silas**, a systems engineer and maker focused on **custom CAD modeling, 3D printing, and programming solutions**.  
My work spans from designing physical mechanisms to writing low-level code that drives them.

## What I Build
- 🖊️ **CAD & Fabrication**: Parametric modeling, compliant mechanisms, and rapid prototyping with 3D printing  
- 💻 **Programming Solutions**: Unity, C++, ASM, C#, Vulkan — from high-level applications to low-level performance tuning  
- 🔗 **Systems Integration**: Bridging hardware and software into reliable, scalable workflows for labs and client projects  

## My Philosophy
I believe in **engineering as craft**: every design should be functional, elegant, and adaptable.  
Whether it’s a spring-loaded pen holder or a containerized print farm, I approach projects with modular design and iterative problem-solving.

## Current Focus
- Delivering **custom CAD models** for mechanical and product design  
- Running a **3D printing pipeline** for prototypes and production parts  
- Developing **software solutions** that connect digital design to physical output
